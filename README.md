# ChordSet
[ChordSet Project Page](https://andyagusportfolio.com/ChordSet).

The goal of ChordSet is to use Augmented Reality to help users learn and implement keyboard shortcuts. 

## Initial set up
- Download or fork the repository 
- Make sure to configure your project with AR Foundation/XR Interaction Toolkit and AR Kit 
- Download [Normcore](https://normcore.io/) and set up your access key
- Use the [AR Foundation Remote] (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/ar-foundation-remote-2-0-201106) for testing

## Creating the builds 
#### You will see three seperate scenes in the App.
- Desktop Scene
- Mobile AR 
- Sandbox (Use this scene mainly for testing and adding new features) 

#### Next

- Create a desktop build, so you can access the text editor as a Mac application.
- Once that is done, you can build the iOS AR App through XCode.
- If everything is setup properly When both apps are running they will interact with one another.
